# Message Vault

The 'Message Vault' - a simple way of transmitting messages and files as secure one time secrets. <br />

All secret values and files uploaded to the application are encrypted with a key only shared to the user at time of secret creation through a URL parameter, meaning any data stored is completely inaccessible to anyone other than the desired recipient. <br />

I mainly built this application to test Laravel Livewire v3; however, it provides a viable alternative to other message sharing websites (such as OneTimeSecret, which Message Vault is inspired by), with extra functionality such as the aforementioned data encryption and the ability to transmit files as well as plain text. <br />

The application is built with PHP (Laravel), vanilla JavaScript and Laravel Livewire.
